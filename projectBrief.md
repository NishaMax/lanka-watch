🌎 Project Summary: Lanka-WatchLanka-Watch is a community-driven, real-time crisis and resource reporting platform tailored for Sri Lanka. It leverages geospatial technology to allow citizens to report, verify, and track localized issues like floods, fuel shortages, and traffic hazards on an interactive map.🏗️ Technical ArchitectureFrontend: React.js (Vite) hosted on Vercel.Backend: FastAPI (Python) hosted on Render.Database: PostgreSQL hosted via Supabase.Maps: MapLibre GL with OpenFreeMap (OpenStreetMap based) tiles.Authentication: Supabase Auth (JWT-based session management).🛠️ Feature List1. Interactive Geospatial InterfaceLive Map: A high-performance map centered on Sri Lanka (defaulting to Ratnapura).Geocoding Search: A central search bar allowing users to "fly" to any city in Sri Lanka using the Nominatim API.Click-to-Report: Users can click anywhere on the map to automatically capture $Latitude$ and $Longitude$ coordinates for a new report.2. Community Reporting SystemCategory Classification: Reports are tagged by type (e.g., Flood, Fuel, Hazard, Traffic).Dynamic Markers: Reports appear instantly as markers.Red Marker: Unverified/New report.Green Marker: Verified report (Trusted by the community).Persistence: All reports are saved in a cloud PostgreSQL database with timestamps.3. Verification & Social LogicCrowdsourced Validation: Users can click a "Confirm ✅" button on any marker to verify the report's accuracy.Promotion Engine: A backend algorithm that automatically changes a report's status to "Verified" once it reaches a threshold (e.g., 3 confirmations).Administrative Control: A delete feature (🗑️) allows for the removal of reports (currently in maintenance mode).4. Data Management & FilteringCategory Filters: A sidebar that allows users to toggle specific issues (e.g., "Show me only Fuel stations").State Synchronization: The map clears and redraws markers automatically when filters or data changes occur.5. Security & IdentityUser Authentication: Integrated Register/Login system.Session Guard: The main map and reporting tools are hidden behind an Auth wall, ensuring only registered users can interact with the community data.Environment Security: Sensitive API keys and database URLs are managed via Environment Variables (Vercel/Render), not hardcoded.
